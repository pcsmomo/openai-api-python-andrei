Listen to part of a lecture in an anthropology class. The professor is talking about human migration. Although we don't think of ourselves as migratory in the way we do of other animal species, people have always been on the move. A few hundred thousand years ago, humans migrated from the savannas of Africa and spread rapidly into present-day Europe and Asia. This migration coincided with successive cycles of glacial periods known as the Ice Age, and it probably occurred as humans followed the advance and retreat of plants and animals. Humans survived the bitterly cold weather that prevailed in these regions due to their ability to make things, such as shelter and clothing, but more importantly due to their ability to control fire. Later migrations took humans to Japan, on to Indonesia, and finally to Australia. They also migrated across the Bering Land Bridge into North America and spread quickly down to the southern tip of South America. Later movements brought people to the eastern part of the Canadian Arctic and to northern Greenland. Human migration has not just involved taking over unused land. People have also invaded land occupied by other peoples through killing, displacing, or genetically mixing with the land's existing inhabitants. Looking at today's world, it is clear that we continue to do this. To sum up, migration seems to be a fundamental human instinct. What is the purpose of the talk? How did people survive the Ice Age in northern Europe and Asia? What does the speaker say about the invasion of occupied land by human groups? What does the speaker say about human migration? The professor briefly explains a series of human migrations. Put the migrations in chronological order.
