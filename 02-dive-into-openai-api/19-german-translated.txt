Hello?

Kid: Great, dad! It's really great here, with the lions. But this lion here, your BQ, is not here. He's probably sleeping inside, right?

Dad: Not today. Because today the lion is not inside, but... ...not here at all. 

Kid: But? 

Dad: At the doctor's. Once a year he's examined, vaccinated, something like that. 

Kid: I understand. 

Dad: But now tell me, how was school? 

Kid: Good. 

Dad: The bandage on your forehead. Where? At the school yard? 

Kid: Doesn't matter. Really, dad. Doesn't matter. 

Dad: No, 

Kid: it doesn't matter. They said things about you.
